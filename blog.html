<p> For this project, there were some troubles that I had to go through. One of
    them was not being able to understand how to format my paragraphs. Some of my
    lines would sometimes go off the page of the website. I also needed to learn
    some of the syntax for HTML since I did not know much. What I learned from
    this assignment would be how to code basic HTML and to make a basic website.
    I did not know much from outside this class and I have no experience. Some 
    resources that helped me in this assignment would be the notes that were
    up on the class website about the basics of HTML and that really helped
    me develop a deep understanding of what I needed to do for the assignment.
